## About

HCA = Hans Christian Andersen (* 2 April 1805 in Odense, Denmark; † 4 August 1875 in Kopenhagen).
 
Andersen is worldwide known and beloved as the author of fairy tales like The Little Mermaid, The Snow Queen and The Ugly Duckling. In his time, he was also recognized as a writer of novels, poems, drama and travelogues. He traveled a lot and had many connections all over Europe.

Hans Christian Andersen is one of the worldwide best known men of his day in the sense that he left behind an unusual amount of sources of knowledge about his life: Foremost three autobiographies, [ten volumes of diaries](http://oraapp.kb.dk/hca_pub/cv/main/Oversigt.xsql?nnoc=hca_pub) and thousands of [letters](http://andersen.sdu.dk/brevbase/). This project is about the letters.
